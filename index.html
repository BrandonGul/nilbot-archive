        While active, NILBOT was a fully functional <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> moderation bot.
        <br><br>
        Using the API provided from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> the bot was able to have tight integration with all of fantasic features it provided.
        <br><br>
        Being built with great open source technologies such as: <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> and <a href="https://tmijs.com/">TmiJS</a>.
        NILBOT was able to achive a high level excellence.
        NILBOT also had a full backend infrastructure to support users and their respective <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> accounts.
        <br><br><br>
        Unfortunately NILBOT was decommissioned in <b>2021</b> due to a lack of users to sustain the project.
        <br><br><br>
        NILBOT was designed and built by Brandon Gulyas. Here are some links to my resources:
